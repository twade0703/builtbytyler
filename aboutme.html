                    <p>My career goals include mastering advanced design tools, developing expertise
                         in aerodynamics, materials science, and propulsion systems, and collaborating
                         on projects that enhance aircraft efficiency safety, and sustainability.</p>

                    <p>As a mechanical engineer, I enjoy exporing diverse interests that complement my core
                         expertise including web development and CAD projects. My primary role involves designing
                          and analyzing mechanical systems, but I also take on GUI development projects to create 
                          tools and platforms that enhance engineering workflows.</p>

                    <h1>Personal</h1>
                    <p>I am a very active person. I enjoy things such as hiking, skateboarding, biking, and sports.
                        I am also in love with the design process; the iterations, the fallbacks, the learning, all of it compels me
                        to push my limits every day. Therefore in my free time, another thing I find myself occupied with is building
                        whatever my mind can produce.
